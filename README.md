## 🎯 Why this exists — the receipts

I'm a solo founder running **6 SaaS products in parallel** — APIs, developer tools, and consumer apps shipped over the last 32 months.

Across those products, the working numbers right now:

```
💰  $1M+         lifetime revenue across all products
💳  6,500+       paying transactions processed
👥  10,000+      paying customers served
🚢  6            production SaaS products shipped
⏱   32 months   from first $1 to today
🧑   1 person    no team, no employees, just AI agents
```

I built **none of this** with a marketing team, a sales department, or a content agency. Just me, a laptop, and a Claude Code window open most of the day.

The 25 skills in this repo are the **exact operating system** I run my businesses on. Not a course, not a framework — the working code I use myself. Every skill in here has been used to ship something real that's now collecting payments on Stripe.

**This is not a hypothetical playbook. It's what's been running my company.**

If you're a solo founder, an indie hacker, or a technical founder who wants to ship like a team of twenty — this is the closest thing to a copy-paste of my workflow you can get.

Show Me The Money is an open-source skill suite for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and compatible AI coding agents. It turns your AI assistant into a full-stack business operating system — discovering opportunities, validating demand, building products, running marketing, managing ads, operating everything autonomously, **and remembering what you decided across every session**.

Works with **Claude Code**, **Codex CLI**, **Gemini CLI**, and other agents that support the skill system.

## ✨ What's New in v2.6.0

**The "come back to /money" release** — an interaction overhaul of the router:

- **Post-task navigation.** `/money` is now dual-mode: after any skill finishes, come back to `/money` and it reads that skill's actual conclusions and recommends 2-3 next moves, each with a "because". A per-skill navigation map (conclusion signal → next step → why) covers the whole suite. You only need to remember one thing: **when unsure what's next, `/money`**.
- **The language menu is gone.** `/money` detects your language from what you write and follows silently — no more "choose your language" gate on every session.
- **Fast-path routing.** Arrive with a clear ask ("my conversion is stuck", "review this before I ship") and you get routed immediately — no onboarding, no business-type quiz, no situation menu. Those questions are now asked lazily, by the skill that actually needs the answer.
- **The proactive handoff.** Every skill ends with one yes/no offer of the most likely next action ("Strategy's set. Want me to start building the MVP right now?") — a concrete action, not a skill name.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1 — Claude Code plugin marketplace

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add iamzifei/show-me-the-money
claude plugin install money@show-me-the-money
```

### Option 2 — npx (works for any agent)

```bash
npx @orrisai/show-me-the-money
```

Then open Claude Code (or Codex CLI / Gemini CLI) and type:

```
/money
```

That's it. The AI will check for prior session state, onboard you if you're new, and guide you through every step.

## 🌟 Why This Exists

Most AI business tools give you generic advice. Show Me The Money gives you **executable workflows** — every skill produces concrete actions, not just analysis. Every phase ends with "Tomorrow's first action: [specific task]."

**Key differentiators:**

- **Personalized** — Auto-researches your background and tailors all recommendations to YOU

- **Full-stack** — Covers the entire business lifecycle, not just one piece
- **Revenue-first** — Every recommendation connects to making money. No fluff
- **Persistent memory** — Decisions, ruled-out directions, and hypotheses survive across sessions via `/money-save`
- **Autonomous** — Set up once, runs 24/7 with `/money-ops`
- **Open source** — CC BY-NC 4.0 license. Free for personal use. Customize, extend, contribute

## 🏗 How It Works

Built on the [Claude Code skill system](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills). Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file containing step-by-step workflows, business frameworks, and decision trees that the AI follows autonomously.

```

├── money-report/SKILL.md       ← Deliverable report generator
└── money-upgrade/SKILL.md      ← Version management
```

State files live in `~/.smtm/sessions/{project}/` (per-project, append-only) and `~/.smtm/reports/{project}/` (timestamped, never overwritten).
